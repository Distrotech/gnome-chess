   GNOME Chess is a simple chess game. You can play against your computer at
   three different difficulty levels, or against a friend at your computer.

  Computer chess enthusiasts will appreciate GNOME Chess's compatibility with
  nearly all modern computer chess engines, and its ability to detect several
  popular engines automatically if installed.
